## About Me 

I have a background in Quality Assurance and Technical Support, and I enjoy learning and exploring different aspects of software development, especially backend development. Right now, Iâ€™m focused on mastering GitHub and improving my transaction manager application. I love working with Python and C#. Feel free to connect with me or browse my projects. Thanks for stopping by!
